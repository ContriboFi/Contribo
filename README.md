**Contribo** is a platform that transforms community capital into productive development.  
Builders earn **USDC** for completing tasks.  
Supporters fund the work and receive **future token allocations** from the projects they help grow.

## 🔍 What is Contribo?

Contribo enables early-stage Web3 projects to get work done now — by splitting incentives:

- **Builders** are paid immediately in stablecoins (e.g. USDC)  
- **Supporters** get token allocations later — if the project succeeds  
- **Projects** bootstrap growth without upfront token emission

This creates a win-win loop: build → fund → earn → grow.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. We **discuss with the community** what kind of contributions are most valuable — what to build, fix, or improve.
2. Supporters fund a USDC pool to pay builders.
3. Builders apply, complete the task, and get paid in USDC.
4. Funders receive claimable token rights after the project’s TGE or milestone.

All flows are verifiable and optionally trustless via smart contracts.
